Here are the main changes for iteration 2:

1) Complet breakdown and re-structure of the code. Refactor into classes that control key parts of the project
2) Testing is upscaled to Unit tests for specific methods, and system tests for the Cell / Grid / Command / File systems
3) Documentations is overhauled to follow the changes made in the code. Testing cases have been outlined, and procedure outlines

Overall:
A major leap has been made in this iteration. The group has really come together as a team to help pull this together.
