GUIDELINE:
 - test for success and failure
 - test boundary conditions
 - test as many combinations as feasable

FUNCTIONALITY TO BE TESTED
 • select a cell 
	(depending on the implementation)
	IF cell selection is (column A..K) + (row number 1..10), 
	- try to select a valid cell
	- try to select a non-existing cell
	- try selecting cell with not-allowed characters
	(3-6 test cases each)

	OR ... if cell selection is (column letter) first, (row number) second
	- try selecting valid ascii characters/ valid number
	- try selecting invalid ascii characters/ valid number
	- try selecting invalid ascii characters/ invalid number
	(3-6 test cases each)

 • enter a primitive value or formula for the selected cell 
	- try entering valid formula
	- try entering invalid formula
	(6-9 test cases each)

 • automatic computation of cell values which are given by formulas 
	- after entering valid data check that formulas are alculated correctly
	- after entering invalid data check for errors
	(6-9 test cases each)

 • output the spreadsheet as a grid of cells with values 
	- check output whith valid data in cells
	- check output whith invalid data in cells
	(6-9 test cases each)

 • load and save spreadsheets to file 
	- try loading a valid spreadsheet
	- try loading an invalid spreadsheet
	(6-9 test cases each)


 • quit
	- check that no errors are thrown when the program terminates
